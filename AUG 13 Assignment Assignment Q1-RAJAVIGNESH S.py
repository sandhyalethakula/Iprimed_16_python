'''
1.Write a program that reads a positive integer, n, from the user and then displays the sum of all of the integers from 1 to n. 
The sum of the first n positive integers can be computed using the formula: sum = (n)(n + 1) / 2 
'''

n = int(input('Enter a number >'))     #input from the user
sum1 = (n)*(nr + 1) / 2       #sum of number form 1 to given number 
print(int(sum1))
