'''write a program that asks the user to enter a string, then prints out each letter of the string doubled and on a seperate line.
for instance, if the user entered HEY, the output would be:
HH
EE
YY  '''


m=input("enter a string:")                    #takes input from user
for i in m:
	print(i*2)                                #prints each letter doubled
