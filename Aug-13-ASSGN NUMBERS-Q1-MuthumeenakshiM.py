'''Write a program that reads a positive integer, n, from the user and then displays the sum of all of the integers from 1 to n. The sum of the first n
positive integers can be computed using the formula: sum = (n)(n + 1) / 2 '''
n=int(input("Enter a number : "))
print("The sum ofof all the natural numbers till ",n,'is',n*(n+1)/2)
